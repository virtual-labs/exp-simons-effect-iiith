        "question": "Choose the correct statement that describes Simon Effect.",
        "answers": {
          "a": "Is a phenomenon in which the tendency to name a color ink in which the word is printed will interfere with the ability to say the name word. ",
          "b": "Is a phenomenon in which participants respond faster and more accurately when the stimulus and response are on the same side than when both are presented on opposite sides. ",
          "c": "Is a phenomenon in which participants fail to perceive objects that are not the focus of attention.",
          "d": "Is a phenomenon that occurs when another person’s behavior provides information about what is true."
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "This is the Stroop Effect, not the Simon Effect. It involves interference between the color of the ink and the word itself.",
          "b": "Correct! This describes the Simon Effect, where reaction times and accuracy are affected by the spatial relationship between stimulus and response.",
          "c": "This is the definition of inattentional blindness, not the Simon Effect.",
          "d": "This is a description of the social influence or informational influence, which is not related to the Simon Effect."

        "question": "What is a common method to reduce the Simon Effect in tasks?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "Training participants to focus on the spatial location of the stimulus.",
          "b": "Increasing the complexity of the task.",
          "c": "Practicing the task repeatedly to reduce interference.",
          "d": "Removing irrelevant spatial information from the task."
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Incorrect. Focusing on spatial location may increase the Simon Effect.",
          "b": "Incorrect. Increasing task complexity does not reduce the Simon Effect.",
          "c": "Correct! Repeated practice can help reduce the interference caused by the Simon Effect.",
          "d": "Incorrect. While this might seem helpful, it is not commonly feasible in real-world tasks."

      {
        "question": "How can the Simon Effect be used in real-world situations?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "To help people respond more quickly when they are distracted by irrelevant information.",
          "b": "To design user interfaces that minimize errors caused by irrelevant information.",
          "c": "To reduce the impact of emotional responses on decision-making.",
          "d": "To improve memory recall by using spatial cues."
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "While this option is related to cognitive processing, it doesn’t directly apply the Simon Effect.",
          "b": "Correct! The Simon Effect can help design interfaces, tasks, and environments where spatial congruence reduces errors and improves reaction time.",
          "c": "This is incorrect, as the Simon Effect mainly deals with spatial congruence rather than emotional responses.",
          "d": "This is incorrect. The Simon Effect focuses on spatial congruence and not memory recall or spatial cues for recall."
