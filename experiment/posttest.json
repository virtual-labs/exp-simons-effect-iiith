      "explanations": {
        "a": "This design could work but not the best as it may cause confusion as the response location exactly align with the stimulus location.",
        "b": "Correct! This design exactly aligns between the stimulus location and the response, leading to better performance.",
        "c": "This option is incorrect as only one of the designs is better based on the Simon Effect.",
        "d": "This option is incorrect as one of the designs is indeed better."

      "question": "How does the Simon effect provide insights into cognitive processes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reveals the impact of irrelevant spatial information on decision-making.",
        "b": "It demonstrates the relationship between stimulus identification and response execution.",
        "c": "It highlights the importance of attentional processes in response selection.",
        "d": "It measures the capacity of short-term memory."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While the Simon Effect does show how irrelevant spatial information can affect decision-making, the main insight it provides is about how response execution is influenced by conflicting spatial information.",
        "b": "Correct! The Simon Effect specifically highlights how stimulus location interacts with response execution, especially when there is a conflict between the two, which leads to slower reaction times.",
        "c": "Attentional processes are involved, but the Simon Effect focuses more on how spatial location influences response execution rather than attention itself.",
        "d": "The Simon Effect is unrelated to short-term memory. It focuses on how spatial conflict affects response selection and reaction times."
