### Theory
The Simon Task is a choice reaction time task where there is dimensional overlap between the irrelevant stimulus and the response.<br> 
The Simon effect is the difference in accuracy or reaction time between trials in which stimulus and response are on the same side and trials in which they are on opposite sides, with responses being generally slower and less accurate when the stimulus and response are on opposite sides.<br>
In essence, it shows that people respond faster and more accurately if there is a match between stimulus and response features (e.g., location, when for example stimulus and response are both located on the left side of oneâ€™s body).<br>
In a typical Simon task, subjects are shown a letter (or some other stimulus) on either the left or the right side of the display. <br>
Subjects are told to press either a left key or a right key based on the identity of the stimulus (e.g. what letter it is).
