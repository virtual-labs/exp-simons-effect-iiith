### Theory
The Simon effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the spatial relationship between a stimulus and the required response affects reaction time and accuracy.The phenomenon is based on the idea that the brain automatically codes the spatial location of a stimulus, even when it is irrelevant to the task, and that this information can activate a corresponding response, even when it is incorrect. For example, when a red stimulus appears on the left side of the screen and the participant has to press the right button based on the color, the left location of the stimulus can trigger a left response, creating a conflict with the right response. This conflict slows down the reaction time and increases the error rate. The phenomenon is stronger when the stimulus and response locations are close together than when they are far apart, suggesting that the spatial coding is relative rather than absolute.<br>
The phenomenon reflects the interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes in attention and decision-making. Bottom-up processes are driven by the sensory features of the stimulus, such as its location, while top-down processes are driven by the task demands and expectations, such as the required response. The phenomenon shows that bottom-up processes can influence top-down processes, even when they are irrelevant and conflicting. The phenomenon also reveals how the brain integrates different types of information (e.g., color and location) in order to produce a coherent and adaptive response.<br>
The Simon effect is usually demonstrated by the Simon task, which involves presenting participants with stimuli (e.g., shapes, colors) on either the left or right side of the screen. They are instructed to respond to the stimuli by pressing a corresponding button on their keyboard, irrespective of the stimulus location. The Simon effect arises when the stimulus and response locations are incongruent, resulting in slower reaction times and reduced accuracy compared to congruent trials.<br>
The theory behind the Simon effect suggests that automatic processing of stimulus location interferes with response selection, leading to the observed differences in reaction times and accuracy. The effect demonstrates the influence of irrelevant spatial information on cognitive processing and provides insights into the mechanisms of response selection during decision-making.<br>
The Simon effect was first reported by American psychologist J.R. Simon in 19691, and has since become one of the most widely studied paradigms in cognitive psychology. It has been used to investigate various aspects of attention, perception, memory, language, emotion, and brain functioning.<br>
