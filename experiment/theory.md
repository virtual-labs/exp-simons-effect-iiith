### Theory
Simon Effect is a phenomenon that is observed when there is an in-compatability between stimulus, i.e., what/ where you perceive, and response, i.e., how you reacted or responded to it [1,3,4]. Simon effect primarily examines the compatibility between stimulus and response locations.<br>

Let's take a look at the design and use of remote control (See figure 1), such as tv remote control (refer to Figure 1). Look at the buttons we use for changing volume and channel. The right and up arrow buttons refer to the “next” change in channel and volume, whereas the left and down arrow buttons refer to “previous/ or past” change channel and volume. It is expected that the stimuli, right and up arrows or left and down arrows, does not only allow users to interpret the displays but also prepare their brain for the corresponding actions [2]. In this case, the semantic meaning of up/right and down/left also facilitates the spatial and temporal processing and strengthens the corresponding action preparedness. Now let's take another example, design of a cup (See figure 2), in which the orientation of the handle determines which hand to be used to pick up the cup effectively. So, if it is left oriented then using left hand would be easier to perform the task than otherwise [1,2].<br>

Do you think the ease of performing the above-mentioned tasks would have been same if the stimulus-perception and corresponding action would have been incompatible or incongruent to each other? In other words, if the display representing change in volume and channel would have been positioned at opposite orientations or locations.<br>

Studies [1, 4], focusing on goal-directed behavior, have shown response latency and poor accuracy when the planning and execution of action does not match the stimulus location and/or its semantic properties. The cost in performance due to mis-match between stimulus and response or perception and action is called Simon effect, named after J.R. Simon, following seminal work on stimulus-response compatibility. In essence, it shows that people respond faster and more accurately if there is a match between stimulus and response features (e.g., location, when for example stimulus and response are both located on the left side of one’s body). Stimulus-response compatibility and its use in design might appear a matter of simple discomfort on a regular day-to-day basis, but it could be a costly and fatal affair when it comes to complex designs like cockpit.<br>

To understand the advantage of compatibility between stimulus and response and cost associated with incompatibility between stimulus and response, Simon developed a choice reaction time task, also known as Simon task. The choice reaction time task is different than simple reaction time task and measures the users’ alertness and decision-making speed to given choices.<br>   

In the real world, the Simon effect has important implications. Primarily, it shows that location information cannot be ignored and will affect decision making, even if the user knows that the information is irrelevant.<br>

The Simon effect (and related phenomena) must be considered in design of human-machine interfaces. Good interfaces display information in ways that match the types of responses people should make. For example, imagine that you are flying a plane, and the left engine has a problem. The indicator for that engine should be to the left of a corresponding indicator for the right engine. If it is the other way around, you may respond incorrectly to the indicator and adjust the wrong engine.<br>

The task consists of two stimuli:  
Fixation: participants are instructed to look at the plus sign “+”. The fixation plus sign is used to prepare the participant for a given trial.  
Color Patch: There are two color patches used in the experiment, such as red and green color patch.  

Task: Participants are instructed in the beginning of the experiment to use a specific response key for a specific color patch. Such as when participants see the “red color patch” they must press “right shift key or return/ enter key” and when they see the “green color patch” they must press “left shift key or caps lock”.<br>

In compatible condition, the red and green color patch appears at the location corresponding to the response location, that is keys positioned at the left or the right side of the keyboard. For instance, the red color patch appears at the right side of the screen and the green color patch appears at the left side of the screen.<br>

In in-compatible condition, the red and the green color patch appears at the opposite locations or contralateral positions to the response locations, that is, red color patch appears at the left side and the green color patch appears at the right side.<br>

Important note: the stimulus location is irrelevant to the task and is not semantically associated. Participants are instructed to press the corresponding key and ignore the location of the stimulus.<br>  

Measure of the performance: The behavioral measure comprises the accuracy and reaction time.
