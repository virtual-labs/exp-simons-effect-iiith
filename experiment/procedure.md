### Procedure
1) Participants will log in to the virtual lab website and access the Simon's effect experiment.
2) A series of trials will be presented on the screen, each consisting of a visual stimulus (e.g., a shape or color) displayed on either the left or right side.
3) Participants will be instructed to press a corresponding key on their keyboard based on the identity and location of the stimulus (e.g., press "A" for one stimulus and "L" for another stimulus).
4) The location of the stimulus (left or right) will be manipulated independently of the required response.
5) The experiment will include congruent trials, where the stimulus location matches the response location (e.g., left stimulus requiring a left key press), and incongruent trials, where the stimulus location is opposite to the response location (e.g., left stimulus requiring a right key press).
6) Participants will perform the task, responding as quickly and accurately as possible to each stimulus by pressing the appropriate key.
7) The experiment will record response times and accuracy for each trial.
