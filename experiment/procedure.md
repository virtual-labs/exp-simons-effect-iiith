### Procedure
In this experiment students need to respond to the words LEFT and RIGHT with "A" key (which is on the left side of the keyboard) and with the "L" key (which is on the right side of the keyboard).
<br>
The Simons effect here simply means that you will respond more slowly to the word LEFT when it appears on the RIGHT side of the screen (i.e., incompatible condition) than when it appears on the LEFT side (compatible condition) of the screen.
