### Procedure  

#### Step 1: Starting the Experiment  
- Launch the experiment.  
- Press the **spacebar** to begin the task.  

#### Step 2: Presenting the Trial  
- A series of trials will appear on the screen.  
- Each trial will display a visual stimulus (e.g.,text "LEFT" or "RIGHT").  
- The stimulus will be shown either on the **left** or **right** side of the screen.  

#### Step 3: Providing Instructions  
- You will receive instructions to press specific keys based on the **identity** and but not **location** of the stimulus:  
  - Press the **"A" key** for a "LEFT" stimulus.  
  - Press the **"L" key** for a "RIGHT" stimulus.  

#### Step 4: Manipulating Stimulus and Response Locations  
- The location of the stimulus (left or right) will vary independently of the required response.  
- The experiment will include two types of trials:  
  - **Congruent Trials**: The stimulus location matches the response (e.g., a left stimulus requires a left key press).  
  - **Incongruent Trials**: The stimulus location does not match the response (e.g., a left stimulus requires a right key press).  

#### Step 5: Recording Performance  
- You must respond as quickly and accurately as possible for each trial and press the correct key based on the stimulus.  

#### Step 6: Collecting Data  
- The experiment will record the following metrics:  
  - **Response Time**: How quickly you respond to the stimulus.  
  - **Accuracy**: Whether you press the correct key.
